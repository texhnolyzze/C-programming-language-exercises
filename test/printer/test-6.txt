"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes
it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly
scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you
had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As
to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his
right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull,
indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons,"
I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as
good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.
The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many are there?"
